# Academic_ComputerVision
<p align="center">
**&lt;WIP>**
</p>

Code developed for academic purposes in 2017.

# Instructions

1.    Main .cpp files should be located in \code (not in \code\src and \code\header_files, folders reserved for own-made small function libraries).
2.    Pictures should be located in \Pictures.
3.    **filedata.txt** should include the name of the main .cpp file to be executed and the names (and paths) of the pictures that are supposed to be loaded.


Tested in Ubuntu 14.04 with OpenCV 3.2.0.

## Disclaimer
This repo will (at least initially) host a number of pictures, so it can turn out to be quite heavy.
