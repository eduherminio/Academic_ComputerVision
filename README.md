# Academic_ComputerVision

OpenCV (C++) wrapper library and basic Computer Vision programs.

Code developed for academic purposes in 2017.

# Instructions

1.    There is a XX_filedata.txt in /code/filedata for each .cpp main file. Choose the one you want to use, move it to /code and rename it to **filedata.txt**. You can edit there the name and location of the pictures you want to be loaded (sample ones are placed in /Pictures)
2.    In /code, run **./compile.sh** to compile and run the file selected in filedata.txt.


Tested in Ubuntu 14.04 with OpenCV 3.2.0.

## Disclaimer
This repo will (at least initially) host a number of pictures, so it can turn out to be heavier than one might expect.
