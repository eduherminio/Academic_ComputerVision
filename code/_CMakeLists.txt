#   use of ‘auto’ in parameter declaration only available with -std=c++14

# set(namefile "0_Intro")
#   creates a variable named namefile

# set(filename $ENV{namefile})
#   accesses an environment variable
#file(STRINGS "filename.txt" filename)
#   creates a variable named filename from the content of filename.txt
